- Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA)
- Cluster Autoscaler
- KEDA (event-driven autoscaling)
- Custom metrics for scaling
- Scaling strategies and limits

**Lab:** Configure HPA with custom metrics

---

### 07. Security and RBAC (50 minutes)
Secure your cluster with role-based access control and security policies.

**Topics:**
- RBAC (Roles, RoleBindings, ClusterRoles)
- ServiceAccounts
- Pod Security Standards
- Network Policies (advanced)
- Secret management (external secrets)
- Security scanning and policies

**Lab:** Implement multi-tenant namespace isolation with RBAC

---

### 08. Multi-Cluster Management (45 minutes)
Manage applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

**Topics:**
- Why multi-cluster?
- Cluster federation concepts
- Cross-cluster service discovery
- Multi-cluster networking
- Disaster recovery strategies
- Tools: kubefed, Cilium Cluster Mesh

**Lab:** Deploy application across two clusters with failover

---

## Environment Requirements

The Part 2 labs require:
- Kind cluster from Part 1 (or fresh multi-node cluster)
- At least 8GB RAM available
- Internet access for pulling additional images
- The workshop container with all tools pre-installed

Some advanced labs (multi-cluster) benefit from:
- Two separate kind clusters
- Additional resources (12GB+ RAM recommended)

## Learning Outcomes

After completing Part 2, you will be able to:
- Expose applications externally with Ingress controllers
- Package and deploy applications using Helm
- Implement GitOps workflows with Flux
- Monitor applications with Prometheus and Grafana
- Implement advanced deployment strategies (canary, blue/green)
- Configure autoscaling based on metrics
- Secure clusters with RBAC and network policies
- Manage applications across multiple clusters

## Additional Resources

See the `resources/` directory for:
- Helm cheatsheet
- Flux CLI reference
- Prometheus query guide
- RBAC examples
- Production readiness checklist
